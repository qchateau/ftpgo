# Quickstart

```
$ go get .
$ go build .
$ ./ftpgo serve ./default_config.yaml
```

# Is this right for me ?

If you need a FTP server that you can set-up on any platform in less
than 5 minutes, this is for you.

If you need a production-ready, featureful FTP server, use something else.

# Why ?

This aims to be a very simple FTP server, usable on many platforms.

It has much less features than many other FTP servers you will find online,
but is supposed to make up for it with simplicity.

# I don't have go installed

You'll find pre-built standalone binaries in my GitHub releases
for most common systems and architectures.
